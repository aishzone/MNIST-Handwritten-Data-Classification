# MNIST-Handwritten-Data-Classification
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a __large database__ of handwritten digits (70,000 -> 60,000 train data & 10,000 test data) that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of __machine learning__.

The __task__ is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of the 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9,inclusively.__Logistic Regression__ is the Supervised Learning Algorithm which can be used to recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

__index.md__ --> It is a github page which explains my entire process+code

__mnist_code.ipynb__ -->Jupyter notebook that consists my entire code.
